#Introduction
In this paper we will be focusing around the impact of a worker's sex on their hourly wage. The dataset we are using for this project is a random sample of 534 people from the 1985 Current Population Survey (CPS) which contains cross-sectional data of potential determinants of wages. In this assignment we will use several statistical techniques we have acquired from our study combined with some real-world knowledge to try and answer some questions one may have about this dataset.

    0. Unmarried
    1. Married

#Background information on the wage gap
Something that comes to mind when thinking of the determinants of wage is a person's level of education. Loosely speaking, one would expect that the more higher your level of education, the more money you will make. There is some empirical evidence behind this claim. If we look at data from the US BLS Annual Demographic Supplement of the CPS from 2013 we find that this is generally true for those above the age of 25. Also, interestingly, if we pay close attention to the scales of each axis, we find that the wage gap is still present.

In this study we will not be looking numerically at the data shown above, instead we will use it qualitatively for some intuition and partial justification for adding education into our multiple linear regression model. Before just wildly throwing a term into our model we can look at the marginal plot of wage versus number of years of education.

#Creating our first model
We first would like to explorer whether the wage gap does exist. In order to do so we first graphed the plot Education vs Wage and differentiated each point by the sex. We then created linear lines for Male and Female to see if there was anything interesting. 
```{r}
#We guess that education and sex will have to do something with wage

p = ggplot(aes(x=EDUCATION, y=WAGE),data=wages)
p + geom_point(data=wages, aes(color=SEX)) #See that a lot of data is clumped together

p + geom_point(data=wages, aes(color=SEX)) + geom_smooth(method='lm', aes(color=SEX), data=wages)
#see that the slopes are very close to identical but have different intercept so there is wage gap
```
We are able to see that the slopes for male and female and quite similar but the intercept for them are different with male having a higher intercept than female. This tells us that male on average make more than females which tells us that there is indeed a wage gap. 
```{r}
mod1 = lm(WAGE~EDUCATION + SEX, data=wages)
summary(mod1) #see that we have low r^2 value and nothing is interesting lets try doing added variable plots
```
Creating a linear model of Education + Sex vs Wage did not having anything interesting as there is a low $R^2$ value. We then started to do added variable plots in order to find if anything else effected wages besides sex. 
#Added variable plot1
We create added variable plots for Experience and Age in order to see whether these two variables add anything new to our old model
```{r}
wages$resid1 = resid(mod1)

p2 = ggplot(aes(y=resid1), data=wages)
p2 + geom_point(aes(x=resid(lm(EXPERIENCE~EDUCATION + SEX, data=wages)))) #has good linear model except for that one outlier

p2 + geom_point(aes(x=resid(lm(AGE~EDUCATION + SEX, data=wages)))) #also a good linear model except for one outlier

mod2 = lm(WAGE~EDUCATION + SEX + EXPERIENCE, data=wages)
```

We can see that both added variable plots have good linear models and both of them have a extreme outlier. For now we leave that outlier a it does not affect the results of the linear model that much. We create model2 by adding Experience to our existing model

#Checking our new model results and comparing it with our old model
```{r}
summary(mod2); summary(mod1)
```
As we can see from the result the $R^2$ value increased from model1 to model2 and the Residual Standard Error(RSE) decreased slightly. Still the new model explains nothing interesting about the effects on wage.

#Added variable plot2
We create a new added variable plot and see if age helps explain out dataset a bit better
```{r}
wages$resid2 = resid(mod2)
p3 = ggplot(aes(y=resid2), data=wages)
p3 + geom_point(aes(x=resid(lm(AGE~EDUCATION + SEX + EXPERIENCE, data=wages))))
```
We see that all of the data is all clumped up together with two extreme outliers. We will see if transforming the data would help fix this issue. 

#Checking for co-linearity
Will define a new variable EDU_PLUS_EXP which is defined to be the number of years of education of a person plus the number of years of experience a person has.
```{r}
ggpairs ( wages, columns = c("EDUCATION","EXPERIENCE","AGE","ED_PLUS_EX", "WAGE") )
```
As you can see from the results ED_PLUS_EXP has a correlation of 1 with age. This shows us that age is not needed in our model as ED_PLUS_EXP with AGE would compete to try to explain WAGE which would create a inaccurate results and data.
#Power Transform
```{r}
powerTransform(cbind())
```
